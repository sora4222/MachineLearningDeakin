    "When you use Microsoft Word, Google Docs, Apple Pages, Open Office, or any other word processing software, you generally use your mouse to select various style options, like line spacing, font size, font color, paragraph format etc. This kind of system is often describes as a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) interface. This means that the input (what you tell the computer) exactly matches the output (what the computer gives back to you). If you type the letter **`G`**, highlight it, select the color green and up the font size to 64 pt, your word processor will show you a fairly large green colored letter **`G`**. And if you print out that document you will print out a fairly large green colored letter **`G`**. \n",

    "This Notebook, however, does not use a WYSIWYG interface. Instead it uses something called a \"[markup Language][]\". When you use a a markup language, your input does not necessarily exactly equal your output.\n",

    "Why is Markdown better? Well, it’s worth saying that maybe it isn't. Mainly, it’s not actually a question of better or worse, but of what’s in front of you and of who you are. A definitive answer depends on the user and on that user’s goals and experience. These Notebooks don't use Markdown because it's definitely better, but rather because it's different and thus encourages users to think about their work differently. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is very important for computer science students to learn how to conceptualize input and output as dependent, but also distinct. One good reason to use Markdown is that it encourages this kind of thinking. Relatedly, it might also promote focus on substance over surface aesthetic. Markdown is somewhat limited in its style options, which means that there are inherently fewer non-subject-specific concerns to agonize over while working. It is the conceit of this philosophy that you would, by using Markdown and this Notebook, begin to think of the specific stylistic rendering of your cells as distinct from what you type into those same cells, and thus also think of the content of your writing as necessarily separate from its formating and appearance.
